# EVOMORPH

## Preface
 
This repository is a rewrite and continuation of my undergrad capstone project. It aims to generalize neural networks into a higher order residual network system, wherein more complicated structures can be formed naturally through a neuromorphic approach to neural architecture search. This projects proof of concept predecessor was only completed to the minimum requirement during the semester I had to work on it, and included a model description language which is not present in this new system, as it was ultimately unnecessary, and was only used to create initial architecture search seeds in leu of a proper model serialization system.
 
This new version is more simple in its construction, and generalizes the neural network system even further, making for a cleaner implementation. It is heavily work in progress.
