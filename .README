# EVOMORPH

## Preface

This repository is a rewrite and continuation of my undergrad capstone project. It aims to generalize neural networks into a higher order residual network system, wherein more complicated structures can be formed naturally through genetic neural architecture search. The original project was called Neuromorph, which was an unknowing misnomer, and had no relation to neuromorphic computing. This predecessor was only completed to the minimum requirement during the semester I had to work on it, and included a model description language which is not present in this new system, as it was ultimately unnecessary, and was only used to create initial architecture search seeds in leu of a proper model serialization system.

This new version is more simple in its construction, and generalizes the neural network system even further. It is heavily work in progress.
